## The Business Model Canvas

- A bit of history :
  
  Developed by Alexander Osterwalder - a Swiss business theorist, author, speaker, consultant and entrepreneur, known for his work on economic modeling.

- Purpose :

    A Business Model describes exactly how your business will earn money - defining what you are going to sell to which customers, for what purpose, in what way and for what benefit.

## Business Model / Business Plan

- **Business Model:**
  The logic for creating added value for customers and revenue generation.

- **Business Plan:**
  The operational and financial implementation of this logic.

## Why use the Business Model Canvas?

- The BMC is visual - it allows you to identify your project at a glance. Its structure, consisting of 9 blocks, provides an overview that is lacking when writing a business plan.

- It allows you to move forward with a good overview of the work to be done right now with the available resources (human, financial and time available) and then by iteration towards the most effective business model.
